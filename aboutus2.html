        <h1>NAFULAMUKE PROJECT</h1> 
        <p id="par">Nafulamuke is a Giriama word that means lets wake up. <br>
        In my project I work with 10 girls and 7 boys aged 10-14 years where we always meet on 
        Monday,Wednesday and Friday <br>
    and have a session with them on drug abuse. The main aim that made me to choose this age age group is that <br>
I wanted them after getting the information to share it with their friends who are not in the project so that <br>
our next generation will avoid using drugs as it is now. Alot of people use  drugs because they lucked the information <br>
on the effects of drug abuse hence by teaching them at this young age our next generation will avoid using drugs</p>
